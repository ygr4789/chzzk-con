This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Puppeteer Setup

This project uses Puppeteer for web scraping in a serverless environment. The setup includes:

- `puppeteer-core` instead of `puppeteer` for smaller bundle size
- `@sparticuz/chromium` for serverless-compatible Chrome binary
- Automatic Chrome installation via postinstall script
- Vercel configuration for proper function timeout and build settings

### Local Development

For local development, Chrome will be automatically installed when you run `npm install`.

### Deployment

The project is configured to work with Vercel's serverless environment. The `vercel.json` file includes:

- Function timeout settings for the Puppeteer API route
- Build environment variables to ensure Chrome is downloaded
